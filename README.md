# Polyp-Detection_ByVOICE

## Introduction  

Polyps are abnormal tissue growths that can occur in the colon and rectum. Detecting them during colonoscopy examinations is essential, as polyps can lead to complications if left untreated. Manual detection is challenging due to variations in size, shape, and appearance.  

This project presents an **automated polyp detection system** that integrates both **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** approaches. The system extracts diverse feature sets and provides a comparative evaluation of traditional ML classifiers and modern DL architectures.  

This work was carried out as part of a **summer internship** under the guidance of professors from **Birla Institute of Technology (BIT) Mesra, Ranchi**.
