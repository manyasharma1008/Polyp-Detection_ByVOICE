# Polyp-Detection_ByVOICE
Introduction
Polyps are abnormal tissue growths that can occur in the colon and rectum. Detecting them during colonoscopy examinations is essential, as polyps can lead to complications if left untreated. Manual detection can be challenging due to variations in size, shape, and appearance.

This project develops an automated polyp detection system using both machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. It leverages time-frequency, acoustic, and spectrogram-based features for traditional ML models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), while also employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for direct image-based detection. The project provides a comparative evaluation of both approaches.
